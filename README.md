## üìä Description of Scripts

- `content_validation.R`: Computes Aiken's V and confidence intervals for expert ratings on item relevance and wording.
- `factor_analysis.R`: Performs dimensionality analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and computes reliability and validity metrics.
- `pilot_study.R`: Handles data cleaning, recoding, descriptive statistics, and estimation of ordinal reliability (Cronbach‚Äôs alpha) for the pilot dataset.

| File                         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `expert_judges_data.xlsx`    | Expert reviewers‚Äô responses regarding item relevance and wording for initial content validation. |
| `data_Aiken_STATS.xlsx`      | Cleaned and reshaped data for Aiken‚Äôs V coefficient and CI estimation.     |
| `pilot_sample.xlsx`          | Dataset from the pilot application of the instrument used for initial reliability and item analysis. |
| `stas_anonymized_data.xlsx`  | Final full sample used for factor structure modeling and validation (EFA/CFA). |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Reproduce the Analyses

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open each script (`.R` files) in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
3. Run the scripts in the following order for full reproducibility:
   1. `pilot_study.R`
   2. `content_validation.R`
   3. `factor_analysis.R`
4. Ensure the `/data` folder is in the working directory.

## üîí Data Provenance and Ethical Compliance

The datasets included in this repository were collected as part of a research project aimed at developing and validating a multidimensional scale to assess technostress, technological self-efficacy, academic performance, and digital safety in undergraduate students.

All participants were first-year university students who voluntarily completed the instrument and provided informed consent for their data to be used in academic research. Data collection procedures complied with ethical standards for research involving human subjects.

The research protocol was reviewed and approved by the **Scientific Ethics Committee of Universidad de Las Am√©ricas (Chile)**. The study adhered strictly to all institutional, national, and international guidelines for ethical conduct and data protection, including anonymity and the implementation of reliability protocols throughout the process.

The datasets are fully anonymized and are provided solely for the purposes of transparency, replication, and academic scrutiny.
